# UVA-Grades-Tool

The purpose of the UVA-Grades-Tool (cool name pending), is to help students make more GPA conscious decisions when selecting classes. In an ideal world,
grades are secondary and students pick classes based on what interests them or what will further their future. But the reality is that GPA still carries
a lot of weight and for some students, keeping their GPA as high as possible is the path to the best future. We hope that this app extends on the data
already available through theCourseForum © and allow students to see even more detail to help them make the best class decisions possible.
